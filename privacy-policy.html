    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Welcome to our Privacy Policy page! When you use our app, you trust us with your information. This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what data we collect, why we collect it, and what we do with it. This is important; we hope you will take time to read it carefully.</p>
    
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect information to provide better services to all our users. We collect information in the following ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Information you give us.</strong> For example, our app requires you to sign up for an account. When you do, we’ll ask for personal information, like your name, email address, telephone number or credit card.</li>
        <li><strong>Information we get from your use of our services.</strong> We collect information about the services that you use and how you use them, like when you watch a video on TikTok, visit a website that uses our advertising services, or view and interact with our ads and content. This information includes:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Device information</li>
            <li>Log information</li>
            <li>Location information</li>

            <li>Local storage</li>
            <li>Cookies and similar technologies</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>How We Use Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to develop new ones, and to protect our users. We also use this information to offer you tailored content – like giving you more relevant search results and ads.</p>
    
    <h2>Information We Share</h2>
    <p>We do not share personal information with companies, organizations and individuals outside of our app unless one of the following circumstances applies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>With your consent.</strong> We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of our app when we have your consent to do so.</li>
        <li><strong>For external processing.</strong> We provide personal information to our affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</li>
        <li><strong>For legal reasons.</strong> We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of our app if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.</li>
            <li>Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.</li>
            <li>Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.</li>
            <li>Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of our app, our users or the public as required or permitted by law.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to access, rectify, or delete your personal data. You can also object to the processing of your personal data or request that we restrict the processing of your personal data. If you have any questions or concerns about our Privacy Policy, please contact us at [Your Contact Information].</p>
    
    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of privacy policy changes).</p>
